Exposition of a Diffraction Shader.


::Warning when downloading::

Viewers: Downloading a .zip should be fine. If you fork/pull, read the developer notice.

Developers: Since you shouldn't be downloading a .zip to develop, you might run into EOL issues. When pulling data, your git client might auto-convert the EOL format of vshader.glsl and fshader.glsl from UNIX (LF) to Windows (CRLF). This results in the shaders failing to compile with an error message regarding an $undefined character at token <undefined>.
